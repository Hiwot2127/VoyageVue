# VoyageVue

Welcome to the VoyageVue GitHub repository! VoyageVue is a web-based solution that leverages Generative AI to predict and manage traffic congestion and enhance commuting in urban areas. This repository contains the source code and development history of the VoyageVue project.

## Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `backend/`: This directory contains the backend code for VoyageVue. It includes the API endpoints, database models, and business logic implemented in Python using the django framework.

- `frontend/`: Here, you will find the frontend code for VoyageVue. This directory also includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the user interface.

- `models/`: This directory contains the trained Generative AI models used by VoyageVue to enhance its capabilities. These models are implemented using Python-based AI/ML libraries and are essential for traffic prediction and route optimization.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide a collaborative space for the development and enhancement of VoyageVue. By making the repository publicly accessible, we encourage developers, contributors, and users to explore the codebase, report issues, and suggest improvements.

## How Generative AI Enhances VoyageVue

VoyageVue harnesses the power of Generative AI models to improve its predictive accuracy. The selected Generative AI models, including fine-tuned models like GPT-2, play a critical role in processing real-time traffic data and generating predictions.

These models use advanced techniques in machine learning and natural language processing to analyze historical traffic data, real-time sensor information, and other relevant factors. By doing so, they generate forecasts of traffic congestion, recommend alternative routes, and provide insights to alleviate congestion.

Generative AI is particularly beneficial for VoyageVue because it can adapt and learn from dynamic traffic patterns, ultimately resulting in more accurate predictions and better route recommendations for users.
