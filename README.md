# VoyageVue

Welcome to the VoyageVue GitHub repository! VoyageVue is a web-based application that leverages Generative AI to enhance commuting in urban areas. This repository contains the source code and development history of the VoyageVue project.

## Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `backend/`: This directory contains the backend code for VoyageVue. It includes the API endpoints, database models, and business logic implemented in node using the Express framework.

- `frontend/`: Here, you will find the frontend code for VoyageVue implemented using React and bootstrap. This directory also includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the user interface.

- `models/`: This directory contains the trained Generative AI models used by VoyageVue to enhance its capabilities. These models are implemented using Python-based AI/ML libraries and are essential for traffic prediction and personalized route optimization based on user's preferences.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide a collaborative space for the development and enhancement of VoyageVue. By making the repository publicly accessible, we encourage developers, contributors, and users to explore the codebase, report issues, and suggest improvements.

## How Generative AI Enhances VoyageVue

VoyageVue harnesses the power of Generative AI models to improve its predictive accuracy and urban commute enhancement which includes generating personalized traffic recommendations. The selected Generative AI models, including fine-tuned models, play a critical role in processing synthetic user data and generating personalized predictions (recommendations) based on that.

Integrating with the map, the models use advanced techniques in machine learning to analyze user data and by doing so, they generate forecasts of traffic congestion, recommend alternative routes based on personal preference, and provide traffic insights (Personalized).

Generative AI is particularly beneficial for VoyageVue because it can adapt and learn from dynamic traffic patterns based on synthetic data from users (historical as well), ultimately resulting in more accurate predictions and better personalized route recommendations for users.
